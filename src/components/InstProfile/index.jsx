                    Starting out at the age of 12 I never stopped learning new
                    programming skills and languages. Early I started creating
                    websites for friends and just for fun as well . Besides web
                    development I also explored Python and other non-web-only
                    languages. This passion has since lasted and lead to my
                    decision of working as a freelance web developer and
                    consultant. The success and fun I have in this job is immense
                    and really keeps that passion burningly alive.
