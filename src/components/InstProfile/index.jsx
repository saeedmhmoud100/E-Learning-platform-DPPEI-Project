                                    Starting out at the age of 12 I never stopped learning new programming skills and languages.
                                    Early I started creating websites for friends and just for fun as well
                                    . Besides web development I also explored Python and other non-web-only languages.
                                    This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a freelance web developer and consultant.
                                    The success and fun I have in this job is immense and really keeps that passion burningly alive.
